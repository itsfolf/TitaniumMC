# TitaniumMC
TitaniumMC is a highly experimental fork of Purpur aiming to provide:
- Options to disable and enable dupe fixes (perfect for some anarchy servers)
- Better performance
- Experimental, niche options to play with
- Bleeding edge patches (could be unstable in some cases)
- More customizability on top of Purpur
